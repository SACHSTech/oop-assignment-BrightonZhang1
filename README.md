## Summary
*Include a brief summary that describes your system that your are modelling*
This is a list program simulating "Netflix". The central class is NetflixList, as it contains all objects within the program. Film is an abstract class that passes down a method to subclasses Show and Movie. Show and Movie are used to display the information about the film back to the user. In the main class, the user is given 4 choices. One of them is to browse any film they would like, and are given a  choice to favourite shows they like. The second choice lets them customize their own list, or the user list. The third choice lets them check for recommendations given based on their own custom list. Finally, the last option lets the user exit the program.
